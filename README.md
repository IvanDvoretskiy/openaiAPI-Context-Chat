# OpenAI Multi-User Chat Example

This repository provides an example of using OpenAI's API to manage multiple chat threads while maintaining context. It eliminates the need for external file storage by managing threads in memory, making it simple and efficient.

## Features
- **Multi-User Management**: Handle multiple users with unique threads.
- **Context Retention**: Keep the conversation context within each thread.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Seamless communication with OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Assistant Customization**: Define instructions, name, and model for your assistant.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openai-multi-user-chat.git
   cd openai-multi-user-chat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

3. **Set API Credentials**:
   Edit the script to add your OpenAI API key, project ID, and organization ID:
   ```python
   GPTAPI_KEY = "your-api-key"
   PRDOJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
   ORGANIZATION_ID = "your-organization-id"
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Start the program:
   ```bash
   python openai_multi_chat.py
   ```

5. **Interact with the Assistant**:
   - Enter a username to create or retrieve a thread.
   - Type your messages to interact with the assistant.
   - Type `exit` or `stop` to end the conversation.

## How It Works

- **Assistant Creation**: If no assistant exists, the script creates one with specified instructions, name, and model.
- **Thread Management**: Each user is assigned a unique thread ID stored in memory.
- **Message Flow**:
  1. User inputs a message.
  2. The script sends the message to the API.
  3. The assistant processes and responds based on the thread's context.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the name of the user: Alice
New thread created for user: Alice
Alice: Hello!
Assistant: Hi Alice! How can I assist you today?
Alice: What's the weather like?
Assistant: I'm unable to access live weather data, but let me know if you need any general information.
```

## Notes
- Ensure your OpenAI API key has the necessary permissions.
- Adjust `time.sleep()` for optimal response processing time if needed.
